# IR-PID-robot
Principles of Engineering Lab 3: IR-sensor based line-following robot.

This [lab assignment](http://poe.olin.edu/lab3.html) involves building mechanical, electrical, and software systems to interface with sensors and actuators to guide a robot along a path. 

To learn more or run this code, see the (soon to be attached!) lab report. The actual .ino file can be flashed onto an Arduino UNO with the Adafruit motor shield, but additional infrastructure including electronics, a robot frame, and 3D printed parts are necessary for a complete assembly.
